	<h1 id="historical-periods-of-the-english-language">Historical periods
of the English language</h1>
<p>The history and development of English literature is commonly divided
into four main periods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Old English (c. 450 – 1066)</p></li>
<li><p>Middle English (1066 – c. 1600)</p></li>
<li><p>Early Modern English (c. 1600 – c. 1700)</p></li>
<li><p>Modern English (c. 1700 – <em>present</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-anglo-saxons">The Anglo-Saxons</h1>
<p>The Old English period starts with the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons
– Germanic tribes, considered the ancestors of the English people –
around the year 450 AD, in England. The language spoken by these tribes
has had the most important role in forming the base of what would become
the English language. Half of the words used in English today are of
Anglo-Saxon origin, and it is in this period that we see the first forms
of literature written in Old English.</p>
<p>The culture of the Anglo-Saxon was mainly Germanic, a culture of
warriors and vikings, and was greatly influenced by their neighboring
civilizations, mainly Vikings, the Danes (modern-day Denmark), and the
Geats (modern-day Sweden). Anglo-Saxons culture was also partly
influenced by the Celtic peoples that have lived previously on the
island, preserving many of the Celtic myths that would serve as a base
for literary creation in the Middle English period. And, lastly, the
culture was also greatly influenced by the introduction of Christianity
by the Romans, and changing moral and social values that contradicted
the <em>heroic code</em>, a set of values and behaviors held by the
Germanic people.</p>
<p>Most of the Anglo-Saxon literature is poetry, of which around 30,000
lines have survived, and consisted mainly of religious poetry and
translations of Books from the Bible. These texts have been written and
preserved in monasteries. Apart from poetry, a few epic poems have
survived as well. The principal sources of texts in Old English come
from the four Old English manuscripts: <em>The Junius Manuscript</em>,
<em>The Exeter Book</em>, <em>The Vercelli Book</em>, and <em>The
Beowulf Manuscript</em>.</p>
<h2 id="beowulf">Beowulf</h2>
<p>The last manuscript contains the most important epic poem written in
Old English, <em>Beowulf</em>, written by an anonymous poet around the
6th or 8th century. The epic poem’s narrative takes place around the 5th
or century in pagan Scandinavia, and tells the story of the eponymous
epic hero of the Geats, Beowulf, who comes in aid of the king of the
Danes, Hrothgar, after having heard that the great mead hall, Heorot, is
under attack by Grendel, a terrifying monster. Beowulf defeats Grendel
with his bare hands, and is praised by the Danes, who celebrate his
victory in the mead hall. However, they are attacked by Grendel’s
mother, who has come to revenge the death of her son. Beowulf hunts her
down and kills her with a giant’s sword that he finds in her lair. The
poem’s narrative then skips to later in Beowulf’s life, now king of the
Geats. His realm is terrorized by a dragon after a thief has stolen some
of its treasure, and thus Beowulf decides to defeat the dragon. After a
failed attempt to kill the dragon with the aid of his servants, Beowulf
decides to follow it into its lair, only accompanied by his loyal
sidekick, Wiglaf. Beowulf succeeds in killing the dragon, but is fatally
wounded in the process. He passes his shield to Wiglaf, who then
arranges Beowulf’s cremation and raises a burial mound by the sea in his
honor.</p>
<p>From the supernatural (monsters, Beowulf’s superhuman strength), to
legendary weapons and creatures (the giant’s sword, the dragon), the
epic poem presents a pagan world of superstitions, fears, beliefs,
myths, and magical objects. Furthermore, the poem is also characterized
by the <em>heroic code</em> followed by the characters, from Beowulf’s
bravery and discipline, to the loyalty and trust of his servants.</p>
<p>Structurally, the poem presents the features characteristic of all
Old English poetry. Instead of rhyming verse, as is common in modern
poetry, alliteration is used. Alliteration is the repetition of the
first sound or set of sounds in the words of a verse. Another common
element of Old Enligsh poetry was the use of the caesura (a break or
pause in the middle of the line), and kennings/picture-names (such as
<em>bone-house</em> for “body”).</p>
<h2 id="christian-values">Christian values</h2>
<p>The Old English poetry reflects the changing moral values of the
Anglo-Saxons after the introduction of Christianity by the Romans. The
religious poetry written in Old English uses many of the themes and
elements of the old pagan heroic stories, and combined them with
Christian values. Many of the authors enjoyed the pagan stories, and
others have written poems reflecting on the changing moral ideals of his
people. Despite the dark and sorrowful themes of these poems, their
message is a call to righteousness and ataraxia.</p>
<p>In <em>The Seafarer</em>, the poet asserts the vanity of earthly
possessions and treasures, since it will no longer be of use in the
afterlife, nor can it benefit the soul after one’s death.</p>
<h1 id="middle-english">Middle English</h1>
<p>The Middle English period starts after the victory of king William
the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest (1066), until around the 15th
century. This period is characterized by a significant French influence
on the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons due to the implementation of
Norman French as a language of court and of the elite. A great number of
French words get borrowed into the language; even today, around 30% of
English vocabulary is of French (or Norman) origin. It is around this
period that the language evolves into a form that is more recognizable
for speakers of Modern English.</p>
<p>Due to the introduction of new social classes, the bourgeoisie of the
ruling class, and inequity between said classes, this period is one of
great tensions between the people. This is further influenced by the
refusal of the people to give up speaking their native language for the
language of the ruling class, French. The Germanic core that still lives
in Modern English is a testament to the resilience of the
Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-ages">The Dark Ages</h2>
<p><em>The Dark Ages</em> is a term originally coined by Italian scholar
and poet, Francis Petrarch (1304 – 1374), which refers to the time span
between the 5th and 14th centuries in Western Europe, or Europe as a
whole. It is the historical period after the fall of the Western Roman
Empire.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, the term was never used during the <em>Dark
Ages</em> per se, but started being used during the Renaissance after
Francis Petrarch coined said term, comparing the cultural, economical
and intellectual “decline” with the “bright” culture and works of the
classical era (the civilization of the Ancient Greeks and Romans).</p>
<h2 id="common-themes">Common themes</h2>
<p>Middle English literature was influenced heavily by medieval French
folklore and literature and features themes common across Europe during
the Medieval period, such as knighthood and chivalry, courtly love, and
the development of allegorical poems and prose.</p>
<p>Knighthood became increasingly common in medieval literature with the
popularization of the Arthurian legends. <em>Le Morte d’Arthur</em>
(Norman French for “The Death of Arthur”) is a collection of tales
rewritten in Middle English about the legendary King Arthur and the
Knights of the Round Table, written by Sir Thomas Malory (1405 –
1471).</p>
<p>Chivalry was a code of conduct developed in Europe around the 11th
century and followed by medieval Christian knights, in various chivalric
orders (confraternities). Knights had to follow a set of values deemed
adequate of a Christian warrior, and were often seen as examples of
pious and honorable fighters.</p>
<h2 id="geoffrey-chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</h2>
<p>Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340 – 1400) is considered the greatest English
poet of medieval times. Educated at Cambridge and Oxford, and having
many connections with the royal court, beginning with his assignment as
page in the household of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third son of King
Edward III, Chaucer had a vast understanding of the multifaceted way of
life. He was sent on several diplomatic missions to France, Italy,
Flanders.</p>
<h3 id="the-canterbury-tales">The Canterbury Tales</h3>
<p><em>The Canterbury Tales</em> (Middle English: <em>Tales of
Caunterbury</em>) is a poetic cycle written by Geoffrey Chaucer around
the 14th century. The collection of 24 stories and over 17,000 lines
tells the story of a group of pilgrims traveling from London to
Canterbury in order to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> at Canterbury Cathedral. During
their travel, each of the pilgrims partakes in a story-telling contest,
the winner of which is promised a free meal at the Tabard Inn on their
way back.</p>
<p>The poetic work, largely regarded a Chaucer’s <em>magnum opus</em>
(most important/valuable work), stands out due to its highly complex and
detailed representation of the social classes during the Middle Ages. In
this sense, each poem serves to show the flaws or values of the social
classes from Chaucer’s time. Each of the pilgrims is characterized
through the stories they tell, their behavior and gestures, the clothing
they wear, and even their physical appearance. The narrator takes the
role of a moral guide for the reader, and offers insight into the way
that the characters think, act, and justify their actions.</p>
<h1 id="early-modern-english">Early Modern English</h1>
<p>The development stage of Early Modern English, sometimes referred to
as <em>Shakespeare’s English</em> or <em>King James English</em><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, started from the beginning of the
Tudor period until around the 17th century.</p>
<h2 id="the-renaissance">The Renaissance</h2>
<p>The Renaissance (from French «renaissance», <em>rebirth</em>) is a
historical and cultural period that started around the 14th century in
the city of Florence, Italy, gradually spreading across the European
continent, and ending around the 16th century. It is a period most known
for its vast expansion of culture in all branches of human creation:
paintings, architecture, sculpture, literature, music, and philosophy. A
living and passionate interest rose for classical antiquity,
particularly ancient Greek and Roman culture.</p>
<p>Many works written in Early Modern English have been greatly
influenced by the Renaissance, such as the theatrical works of William
Shakespeare.</p>
<h2 id="william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</h2>
<p>William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright and actor born
circa the 23th of April 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. He is widely
regarded as the greatest writer of the English language and the most
important dramatist in the world. He is also sometimes referred to as
the <em>Bard of Avon</em>, due to his influence on English culture and
literature.</p>
<p>His works encompass a plethora of themes, ranging from historical
plays, narrative legends and myths, poems, and is, perhaps, best known
for his sonnets.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s plays are divided into three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comedies</p></li>
<li><p>Historical plays (Histories)</p></li>
<li><p>Tragedies</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the historical plays are sometimes merged into one category
along with the tragedies.</p>
<h3 id="the-comedies">The Comedies</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A comedy is a dramatic play that has a light or humorous tone, meant
to induce a state of laughter, through the use of amusing or improbable
events, actions and behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakespeare’s comedies feature heavily ironic and witty dialogue,
clever wordplay, confusing/convoluted plots and amusing characters. In
total, Shakespeare has written 16 comedies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A historical play is a theatrical genre that focuses on presenting
historical events. The genre emerged from tragedy during the Renaissance
period in England, and is often considered a subset of tragedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakespeare’s histories are a collection of biographies of the
English kings from King John up to king Henry VIII. The history plays
are sometimes counted together with the tragedy plays due to their
themes. Furthermore, many of Shakespeare’s tragedies dealt with
historical themes. The plays are, in order:</p>

<h3 id="the-sonnets">The Sonnets</h3>
<p>The Sonnets are Shakespeare’s most popular and studied literary work.
The style of the sonnets is considered a continuation of the sonnet
tradition started in the Renaissance by Francis Petrarch in Italy (the
name <em>sonnet</em> actually comes from the Italian <em>sonetto</em>,
meaning “little song”), ultimately refined for the English language by
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Howard,_Earl_of_Surrey">Henry
Howard</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of poetic construction, Shakespeare’s sonnets all have 14
lines, being divided into 3 <em>quatrains</em> (a stanza of four lines)
and a final <em>couplet</em> (two successive lines), use the <em>iambic
pentameter</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and follow a specific rhyming
scheme (<code>a-b-a-b // c-d-c-d // e-f-e-f // g-g</code>).</p>
<p>In total, Shakespeare has written 154 sonnets, which feature a broad
selection of themes and ideas, such as: mortality, love, beauty, time,
jealousy, etc. The first part of the sonnets (Sonnets 1-126) are
addressed to a young man, and the second part (Sonnets 127-152) to a
woman, known as the <em>dark lady</em>.</p>
