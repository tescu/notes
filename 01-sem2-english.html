	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Early Modern English literature represents the building block of most
of the practices that we can find today in modern English literature,
from the literary devices to themes, philosophical views, and even
character tropes. This document serves as a quick glance over the twists
and turns taken throughout history that have lead to the creation of the
modern English novel, poetry, and literature as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="john-milton">John Milton</h2>
<p>John Milton (1608 – 1674) is one of the most substantial figures in
the creation of modern English poetry.</p>
<h3 id="paradise-lost"><em>Paradise Lost</em></h3>
<div class="image">
<p><img

alt="paradise-lost" /> Satan, as drawn by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Gustave_Dor%C3%A9">Gustave
Doré</a>, in John Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Paradise Lost</em> is an epic poem in blank verse<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
written by John Milton and published in the year 1667. The work was
originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being arranged
in twelve books, as in Virgil’s Aeneid, to more closely represent the
model of classical epic poems.</p>
<p>The poem is considered to be Milton’s <strong>magnum opus</strong>,
leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English
literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the
well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the
story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and
subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the
Garden of Eden.</p>
<h4 id="major-themes">Major Themes</h4>
<p>The poem features many Biblical themes, retelling the story of
Genesis, the first book of the Bible. In his own words, Milton wrote the
poem to <em>“justify the wayes of God to men”</em>, serving as a means
for describing his views on two important elements of Christian
theology: human free will, and the origin of evil.</p>
<p>The primary theological idea debated in <em>Paradise Lost</em> is the
nature of free will, in regards to two contrasting views common of his
time: the Calvinist doctrine, that denied the existence of humanity’s
free will in concordance with Calvin’s view on predestination<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the humanist view that centers
on the freedom of the will.</p>
<p>In Milton’s view, denying the existence of man’s freedom of choice
turns man into a slave of his own reactions and decisions as one can
deny any moral responsibility of his actions. However, if one assumes
that free will does exist, they take full responsibility of their
actions. It is under this framework that the poem describes the origin
and nature of evil as the consequence of man’s free will, and not the
responsibility of God:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I made him just and right,</em><br />
<em>Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.</em><br />
<em>Such I created all th’Ethereal Powers</em><br />
<em>And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed;</em><br />
<em>Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell”</em></div>
<p><sup><em>(Book III, 98 – 102)</em></sup></p>
<h4 id="construction">Construction</h4>
<p><em>Paradise Lost</em> features many of the literary techniques
common in the works characteristic of Ancient Roman and Greek society,
adapting the format of the epic poem to Christian morality and ideas.
One such example can be seen in the opening of the poem, where the
traditional poetic device of invocation is used. Instead of invoking the
muses as is done in traditional epics, Milton addresses God as his
<em>“Heav’nly Muse”</em>.</p>
<p>Another important poetic device used by Milton is
<em>personification</em>, giving something that isn’t living or a person
human traits, such as emotions and a gender. We can observe this in Book
6, describing the fall of Satan and his army into Hell, after being
chased away by Jesus Christ on a flaming chariot:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“Yet half his strength he put not forth, but
checked</em><br />
<em>His thunder in mid volley; for he meant</em><br />
<em>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:</em><br />
<em>The overthrown he raised, and as a herd</em><br />
<em>Of goats or timorous flock together thronged</em><br />
<em>Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued</em><br />
<em>With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds</em><br />
<em>And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,</em><br />
<em>Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed</em><br />
<em>Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight</em><br />
<em>Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse</em><br />
<em>Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw</em><br />
<em>Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath</em><br />
<em>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.</em><br />
<em>Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw</em><br />
<em>Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled</em><br />
<em>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep</em><br />
<em>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.</em><br />
<em>Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,</em><br />
<em>And felt tenfold confusion in their fall</em><br />
<em>Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout</em><br />
<em>Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last</em><br />
<em>Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;</em><br />
<em>Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire</em><br />
<em>Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.”</em></div>
<p>Hell, despite being a place, is described as a <em>she</em>, and is
frightened at the sight of Satan’s fall: <em>“[…] Hell saw Heaven
ruining from Heaven, and would have fled affrighted, but strict Fate had
cast too deep her dark foundations […]”</em>.</p>

alt="defoe" /> Portrait of Daniel Defoe.</p>
</div>
<p>Daniel Defoe (1660 – 1731) was an English writer, merchant, and spy
for both the Whigs and the Tories<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. His work was diverse
and dynamic, from being an inventor and a bankrupt, to working as a
politician, a businessman, and in journaling. His literary career was
quite strong, having written over 250 works on a multitude of
topics.</p>
<p>Despite being an extremely prolific writer, Defoe started his novel
writing later in his life, having written his first novel, <em>Robinson
Crusoe</em>, in his late fifties. Nevertheless, Defoe is best known for
his novels, and is considered by many critics as <em>the inventor of the
modern English novel</em>, since he was the first major English novelist
to break away from the traditional formulas of literature (romances,
epics, legends, allegories, and others), instead opting to write using
real events as his inspiration, combining fiction with reality.</p>
<p>One such example of his blending of fiction and reality can be found
in his first novel, which was most likely inspired by the many cases of
real-life castaways, particularly the case of a Scottish sailor named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk">Alexander
Selkirk</a>, who was stranded for four years on an uninhabited island,
named Robinson Crusoe Island since 1966, close to the Chilean coast.</p>
<h3 id="robinson-crusoe"><em>Robinson Crusoe</em></h3>
<p>The first novel written by Daniel Defoe is <em>Robinson Crusoe</em><a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, published on the 25th of April
1719. It enjoyed almost immediate success and was greatly appreciated by
readers for the story’s verisimilitude (convincing rendition of reality)
and captivating adventures. Defoe immediately followed the novel with
two sequels, <em>The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</em>, the
same year, and <em>Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick
World”</em>. The novel was so successful its first volume went through
four editions by the end of the year, and was translated into a great
number of languages (including smaller languages such as Coptic and
Maltese). In fact, its legacy was so strong that the term “Robinsonade”
was chosen to refer to the genre of adventure-focused stories that
followed the model of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>
<p>One of the novel’s particularities and a characteristic feature of
Daniel Defoe’s novel writing, is the autobiographical narrative and
usage of the story as a means to conceal a moral message.</p>
<h2 id="jonathan-swift">Jonathan Swift</h2>

</div>
<p>Jonathan Swift (1667 – 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and
Anglican<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> cleric, who lived during the
Georgian era (1714 – c. 1830). His most known works are all satires,
leading to many critics granting him the title of <em>the greatest
satirist of the Georgian era</em>.</p>
<h3 id="political-activity">Political activity</h3>
<p>Swift frequently wrote about the political issues of his time and
acted as a voice for the difficulties of living faced by the Irish
people.</p>
<h3 id="a-modest-proposal"><em>A Modest Proposal</em></h3>
<p>Published in the year 1729, under the full name: <em>“A Modest
Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen
to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the
Publick”</em>, is a Juvenalian<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> satire written by
Jonathan Swift. The satire’s shock factor is immense and instant, having
lead to a backlash from an important number of the Georgian elite of
Swift’s time.</p>
<p>Structured as an essay, <em>A Modest Proposal</em> claims to provide
a simple and efficient solution for the social and economic troubles
faced by poor people in Ireland: fattening their babies to sell them as
“delicious” food for the rich. The essay uses the characteristic
inconsiderate and cold language one may find in a typical report of the
time, along with vocabulary commonly used to refer to cattle and other
live stock, with harsh criticism of the immorality of the upper
class.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I do therefore humbly offer it to publick
consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already
computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one
fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black
cattle, or swine; and my reason is, that these children are seldom the
fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages,
therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the
mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render
them plump, and fat for a good table.”</em><br />
<br />
<em>“I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper
for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents,
seem to have the best title to the children.”</em></div>
<h3 id="gullivers-travels"><em>Gulliver’s Travels</em></h3>
<div class="image">
<p><img
src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Laputa_-_Grandville.jpg"
alt="laputa" /> Laputa in <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> is Swift’s most popular and appreciated
work, published on published the 28th of October, 1726, under the
original title: <em>“Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World.
In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain
of Several Ships”</em>. The work serves both as an astounding piece of
literature read and enjoyed by all ages, as well as a witful critique of
human nature and the Robinsonade literary genre, popularized by Daniel
Defoe’s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>
<p>The novel’s story is split into four parts, describing Lemuel
Gulliver’s travels across a wide range of fictional as well as real
places: Lilliput (an island inhabited by tiny people), Brobdingnag (an
island where everything, including the people, is huge), Laputa,
Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, Japan, and the Land of the
Houyhnhnms (a place inhabited by speaking, sentient horses that use a
human-like race, called the Yahoos, as slaves). Swift seeks to make fun
of the usually exaggerated and nonsensical travels that had become
popular in “traveller’s tales” literature, as well as parody key
elements of his time: politics, religion, science, and philosophy. In
Swift’s own words, he wrote <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> <em>“to vex the
world rather than divert it”</em>, and indeed this book’s paradox is its
popularity as a children’s novel and it being a harsh and savage
critique on humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>The novel’s cultural influence is quite considerable. The term
<em>Lilliputian</em> has entered many languages as an adjective for
describing anything miniature or delicate; likewise, the term
<em>Brobdingnagian</em> is included in the Oxford English Dictionary to
describe anything gigantesque.</p>

</div>
<p>Laurence Sterne (1713 – 1768) was also an Anglo-Irish novelist and
Anglican cleric, and the son of an officer in the army. His most popular
work is the comic novel <em>Tristram Shandy</em>. Unlike the previous
authors mentioned above, Sterne’s writing style is unique in its long
essay-like passages, that in some regards can be seen to anticipate the
modern writing technique called <em>‘stream of consciousness’</em> as
can be found in James Joyce’s<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> works.</p>
<h3 id="the-life-and-opinions-of-tristram-shandy-gentleman"><em>The Life
and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em></h3>
<p><em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em> is a
comic novel written by Laurence Sterne and published in nine volumes,
from 1759 to 1767. The novel stood out due and rose to an immediate
popularity due to its peculiar and almost cynical style of humor, as
well as its whimsical, almost ludic plot and dialogue. An eccentric
novel unlike most typical books, considered by many critics puzzling and
peculiar. Whereas most stories begin with the main character, the
novel’s first two volumes describe Tristram’s conception and unfortunate
series of events that have led to his deplorable condition, told by the
man himself, accompanied by his opinions on the matter, as can be seen
in the introduction:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I wish either my father or my mother, or
indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had
minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly consider’d
how much depended upon what they were then doing; that not only the
production of a rational Being was concern’d in it, but that possibly
the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and
the very cast of his mind; and, for aught they knew to the contrary,
even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the
humours and dispositions which were then uppermost; Had they duly
weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly, I am verily
persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from
that, in which the reader is likely to see me. Believe me, good folks,
this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it; you
have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are
transfused from father to son, etc. etc. and a great deal to that
purpose: Well, you may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man’s
sense or his nonsense, his successes and miscarriages in this world
depend upon their motions and activity, and the different tracks and
trains you put them into, so that when they are once set a going,
whether right or wrong, ’tis not a half penny matter, away they go
cluttering like hey-go-mad; and by treading the same steps over and over
again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as smooth as a
garden walk, which, when they are once used to, the Devil himself
sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.”</em></div>
<p><sup>(Volume 1, Chapter 1)</sup></p>
<p>One of the novel’s themes is Tristram’s fate, which has been indeed
decided long before his actual birth, as can be seen in the passage
above. However, his long stream of unlucky setbacks don’t end here; in
fact, even his name is the result of one of the many tragic errors that
happen both before and throughout his life:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>«“No, no, said my father to Susannah, I’ll
get up”</em><br />
<em>“There is no time, cried Susannah, the child’s as black as my
shoe.”</em><br />
<em>“Trismegistus, said my father – But stay; thou art a leaky vessel,
Susannah, added my father; canst thou carry Trismegistus in thy head,
the length of the gallery without scattering.”</em><br />
<em>“Can I?” cried Susannah, shutting the door in a huff.</em><br />
<em>“If she can, I’ll be shot”, said my father, bouncing out of bed in
the dark, and groping for his breeches.</em><br />
<em>Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.</em><br />
<em>My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.</em><br />
<em>Susannah got the start, and kept it; “’Tis Tris-something, cried
Susannah, There is no christian name in the world, said the curate,
beginning with Tris-but Tristram. Then ’tis Tristram-gistus”, quoth
Susannah.</em><br />
<em>“There is no gistus to it, noodle! – ’tis my own name”, replied the
curate, dipping his hand as he spoke into the bason – “Tristram!”, said
he, etc. etc. etc. etc. so Tristram was I called, and Tristram shall I
be to the day of my death.»</em></div>
<p>Etymologically, the name <em>Tristram</em> comes from the Latin term
“tristis”, which means “sad” or “sorrowful”, in terms with the outcome
of Tristram’s naming.</p>
<h1 id="literary-currents-and-movements">Literary Currents and
Movements</h1>
<h2 id="romanticism">Romanticism</h2>
<p>Romanticism started off as a literary movement in reaction against
Classicism and Neoclassicism, in what is called the Pre-Romantic Age,
during roughly the last 30 years of the 1700s. Most of the themes
present in Pre-Romantic literature can be found in Romantic literature
or have slightly evolved in their fully matured Romantic themes and
ideas. Some of the most important Romantic themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A preference for all that is emotionally and spiritually charged,
encapsulated in a few representative locations: ruins, graveyards; as
well as states of the mind and soul: solitude, melancholy, nostalgia,
reverie.</li>
<li>The usage of common/everyday language, as opposed to the complex and
sophisticated language that was common during the Enlightenment. In
turn, this also sparked a revival of language dialects.</li>
<li>A refusal or distaste for the rigid and sterile style of writing
characteristic of texts of the Classical and Neoclassical period,
replaced by personal taste, imagination, and the irrational.</li>
<li>An increasing passion for the Middle Ages and Medieval Times, being
seen as a mysterious and vulgar era.</li>
<li>An interest for the exotic, strange, and supernatural.</li>
<li>An interest in Gothic architecture and society due to its dark and
brutal spirit, characteristic of the barbarous period (s. <a
href="#gothic-literature">Gothic Literature</a>).</li>
<li>The nobilization of the Natural world and of primitive ways of
living (s. <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Noble_Savage">The

</ul>

</div>
<p>William Wordsworth (1770 – 1850) was an poet from a small English
town in Cumbria (Cumberland). His work is considered to have started the
Romantic poetry movement in Britain after having collaborated with <a
href="#samuel-taylor-coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> in creating
<em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in the year 1798.</p>
<p>One of Wordsworth most popular poems is <em>“I Wandered Lonely as a
Cloud”</em>, published in 1807:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I wandered lonely as a cloud</em><br />
<em>That floats on high o’er vales and hills,</em><br />
<em>When all at once I saw a crowd,</em><br />
<em>A host, of golden daffodils;</em><br />
<em>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</em><br />
<em>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</em><br />
<em>Continuous as the stars that shine</em><br />
<em>And twinkle on the milky way,</em><br />
<em>They stretched in never-ending line</em><br />
<em>Along the margin of a bay:</em><br />
<em>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</em><br />
<em>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</em><br />
<em>The waves beside them danced, but they</em><br />
<em>Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:</em><br />
<em>A poet could not but be gay,</em><br />
<em>In such a jocund company:</em><br />
<em>I gazed - and gazed - but little thought</em><br />
<em>What wealth the show to me had brought:</em><br />
<em>For oft, when on my couch I lie</em><br />
<em>In vacant or in pensive mood,</em><br />
<em>They flash upon that inward eye</em><br />
<em>Which is the bliss of solitude;</em><br />
<em>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</em><br />
<em>And dances with the daffodils.”</em></div>
<p>The poem is written in iambic tetrameter<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and
features a quatrain-couplet rhyming scheme – that is, the ABABCC
pattern, and describes a walk in the countryside, where the poet becomes
fascinated by a small spot of flowers (golden daffodils), comparing
their beauty to that of cosmic proportions (<em>“Continuous as the stars
that shine / And twinkle on the milky way”</em>), and the mesmerizing
waves in the bay, but still finds them more valuable and delightful
(<em>“[…] but they / Out-did the sparkling waves in glee”</em>). It ends
with a reflection on solitude and how, after having seen the beautiful
flowers, the poet is elated by their memory (<em>“In vacant or in
pensive mood, / They flash upon that inward eye / Which is the bliss of
solitude; / And then my heart with pleasure fills, / And dances with the
daffodils.”</em>).</p>
<p>In typical Romantic fashions, many of the movement’s most major
themes are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>The poem’s theme is nature, and features natural elements throughout
(the hills and valleys, the lake, the daffodils themselves). These
elements also symbolize Romantic themes (the cloud – a symbol of the
connection between humanity and nature, and the daffodils — a symbol of
beauty).</li>
<li>The language is simple and accessible; it can be understood by
anyone, unlike the elevated language of the Enlightenment.</li>
<li>The poem features strong emotions such as happiness, joy, and
bliss.</li>
<li>The connection between the poet and the surrounding nature is
described with a spiritual quality, characteristic of Romantic
ideals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="samuel-taylor-coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h3>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772 – 1834) was an English poet,
considered, alongside William Wordsworth, one of the initiators of the
Romantic poetry movement in Britain. Some of his most famous works
include the poems written in collaboration with William Wordsworth in
their volume <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), as well as <em>Kubla
Khan</em> (written 1797 – published 1816), and <em>Christabel</em>
(1816).</p>
<h3 id="john-keats">John Keats</h3>
<p>John Keats (1795 – 1821) was an English poet born in London. He is
best known for his 1819 series of odes, considered some of the best in
English literature:</p>

<li><em>Ode on Indolence</em></li>
<li><em>Ode on Melancholy</em></li>
<li><em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em></li>
<li><em>Ode to Autumn</em></li>
<li><em>Ode to Psyche</em></li>
<li><em>Ode to a Nightingale</em></li>

alt="the-lamb" /> <em>The Lamb</em> from William Blake’s <em>Songs of
Innocence</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>William Blake (1757 – 1827) was an English poet, illustrator, and
painter, possessing an impressive imagination due to the visions he has
experienced since his childhood. William’s work was diverse and rich in
themes and motives, but focused almost entirely on Religion, through
which he sought to develop his idea of imagination as “the body of
God”.</p>
<p>Two of Blake’s most studied collection of poems are <em>Songs of
Innocence</em>, published in 1789, and <em>Songs of Experience</em>,
published in 1794, which were later combined into one collection
entitled <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Shewing the Two
Contrary States of the Human Soul</em>, in 1794, featuring colored
illustrations representing each poem. Both volumes were redacted
entirely by Blake and his wife Catherine Blake, who helped with
engraving, coloring, and additional touches.</p>
<p>Blake’s work can be considered as the founding stone for Romantic
literature in English. As the collection’s subtitle may suggest, Blake
uses the contrast between the two volumes, one describing the pure and
innocent state of childhood, and the other describing the corrupt and
fallen world, to illustrate the contrary and uncertain state of
mankind’s moral and intellectual condition. Two poems can be analyzed to
best exemplify the uniting contrast between the two volumes: <em>The
Lamb</em>, from <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, and <em>The Tyger</em>,
from <em>Songs of Experience</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-lamb"><em>The Lamb</em></h4>
<p>The poem’s text:</p>
<div class="line-block">  <em>“Little Lamb who made thee</em><br />
  <em>Dost thou know who made thee</em><br />
<em>Gave thee life &amp; bid thee feed,</em><br />
<em>By the stream &amp; o’er the mead;</em><br />
<em>Gave thee clothing of delight,</em><br />
<em>Softest clothing wolly bright;</em><br />
<em>Gave thee such a tender voice,</em><br />
<em>Making all the vales rejoice:</em><br />
  <em>Little Lamb who made thee</em><br />
  <em>Dost thou know who made thee</em><br />
<br />
  <em>Little Lamb I’ll tell thee,</em><br />
  <em>Little Lamb I’ll tell thee:</em><br />
<em>He is called by thy name</em><br />
<em>For he calls himself a Lamb.</em><br />
<em>He is meek &amp; he is mild,</em><br />
<em>He became a little child:</em><br />
<em>I a child &amp; thou a lamb,</em><br />
<em>We are called by his name.</em><br />
  <em>Little Lamb God bless thee,</em><br />
  <em>Little Lamb God bless thee.”</em></div>
<p>Blake’s lyrical and poetic genius shines brightly throughout the
poem’s verses. It is narrated from a child’s point of view (a common
theme in <em>Songs of Innocence</em>) who contemplates one of God’s
creations, and addresses the lamb directly, presented in the poem
through apostrophe<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, a poetic device (<em>Little Lamb,
who made thee / Dost thow know who made thee</em>).</p>
<p>The Christian parallels and message is clear, comparing a lamb to our
Lord, Jesus Christ, the one who <em>“calls himself a Lamb”</em>, and
<em>“became a little child”</em> being born of the Virgin Mary. The
title “Lamb of God” is strongly tied to Christian values, appearing in
John 1:29, where John the Baptist sees Jesus and proclaims: <em>“Behold
the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”</em>; it is by this
very title that Blake draws the similarities between Christ’s peaceful
nature and innocence and the meekness and mildness of a lamb (<em>He is
meek &amp; he is mild</em>). The poem concludes with the reminder that
by Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross, we are called by His name to follow
Him: <em>I a child &amp; thou a lamb, / We are called by his
name.”</em></p>
<p>One of the poem’s primary themes is that of a mild and peaceful
creator, a loving God who cares for all of His creation (<em>Gave thee
life &amp; bid thee feed, / By the stream &amp; o’er the mead;</em>).
This is in direct contrast with the way God is described in <em>The
Tyger</em>, the poem bellow.</p>
<h4 id="the-tyger"><em>The Tyger</em></h4>
<p>The poem’s text:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“Tyger Tyger. burning bright,</em><br />
<em>In the forests of the night;</em><br />
<em>What immortal hand or eye.</em><br />
<em>Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</em><br />
<br />
<em>In what distant deeps or skies.</em><br />
<em>Burnt the fire of thine eyes?</em><br />
<em>On what wings dare he aspire?</em><br />
<em>What the hand, dare sieze the fire?</em><br />
<br />
<em>And what shoulder, &amp; what art,</em><br />
<em>Could twist the sinews of thy heart?</em><br />
<em>And when thy heart began to beat.</em><br />
<em>What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet?</em><br />
<br />
<em>What the hammer? what the chain,</em><br />
<em>In what furnace was thy brain?</em><br />
<em>What the anvil? what dread grasp.</em><br />
<em>Dare its deadly terrors clasp!</em><br />
<br />
<em>When the stars threw down their spears</em><br />
<em>And water’d heaven with their tears:</em><br />
<em>Did he smile his work to see?</em><br />
<em>Did he who made the Lamb make thee?</em><br />
<br />
<em>Tyger Tyger burning bright.</em><br />
<em>In the forests of the night:</em><br />
<em>What immortal hand or eye.</em><br />
<em>Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?“</em></div>
<p>Compared to the previous poem, <em>The Tyger</em>’s style is a lot
darker and menacing. The poem’s mood is also darker, using imagery that
reminds of dangerous and, at times, terrifying objects, emotions, and
events. The focus here is on God’s power and omnipotence, rather than
His peaceful and mild character (<em>What immortal hand or eye. / Could
frame thy fearful symmetry?</em>), even the lyric voice asks in shock
how the same creator described in the previous poem is capable of
creating such a ferocious beast (<em>Did he who made the Lamb make
thee?</em>). The tiger is described using terminology reminiscent of
war, conflict, and big weapons/tools (<em>What the hammer? what the
chain, / In what furnace was thy brain? / What the anvil?</em>).</p>
<hr />
<p>Through juxtaposition, the two poems share a common element which
reveals that, despite their stark contrast, there is one theme that
unites them: human curiosity. Regardless of our age and background,
curiosity is the force that makes all of us ask questions, address the
unaddressed, and seek the unknown.</p>
<h3 id="lord-byron">Lord Byron</h3>
<p>Lord Byron (1788 – 1824), also known as George Gordon Byron, was an
English poet, known for his extravagant lifestyle and passionate
Romantic themes abundant in his poetry, characteristic of the <em>Sturm
und Drang</em> motif<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. His most known works are
<em>Beppo</em> (1818), and <em>Don Juan</em> (1812). Both of the
aforementioned poems use a rhyming scheme called <em>ottava rima</em>,
characteristic of his work.</p>
<h2 id="gothic-literature">Gothic Literature</h2>
<p>Gothic literature can be considered as a “subset” of Romantic
literature, in that it heavily borrows from the former, and the two
genres are often considered codependent. Much like in Romantic
literature, the Gothic genre focuses on supernatural themes, emotions
and passions as opposed to pure rationality, and emotionally and
spiritually charged places and states of mind. Some of the main Gothic
themes that are different from Romanticism are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A presence of the dead and undead, corpses, and anything
macabre.</strong><br />
In Gothic stories, the line between the living and the dead is thin,
sometimes nonexistent.</li>
<li><strong>Dark, gloomy and mysterious or haunted places, such as:
cemeteries, abandoned castles, dimly lit forests and ghost
towns.</strong><br />
Sometimes, this can also be found in the atmosphere, where actions take
place in the dark, during moonless nights or in thunderstorms.</li>
<li><strong>Loneliness and isolation.</strong><br />
Usually, the main character or cast of characters live in a state of
isolation and solitude; either by their own will, or due to an external
cause.</li>
<li><strong>Curses, secrets and mysteries.</strong><br />
Characters can have a secret or a curse that awaits to be discovered,
leading to a sentiment of stress and gloom. Sometimes, this leads into
the destruction of the cast of characters or entire families.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bram-stoker">Bram Stoker</h3>
<p>Bram Stoker (1847 – 1912) was an Irish novelist. He is best known for
his Gothic horror novel <em>Dracula</em>, considered one of the classics
of English literature, that revolutionized the Vampire fiction
scene.</p>
<h4 id="dracula"><em>Dracula</em></h4>
<p><em>Dracula</em> is a Gothic horror novel written by Bram Stoker’s
and published in the year 1897. The novel may have been influenced by
Jules Verne’s 1892 Gothic novel <em>Le Château des Carpathes</em>
(<em>The Carpathian Castle</em>), but differs in its horror elements and
the iconic character of Count Dracula. Bram Stoker may have also taken
inspiration from a great number of Romanian and Slovakian mythology and
folklore, as well as the historical figure of Vlad Țepeș (Vlad the
Impaler), a Wallachian prince. The name <em>Dracula</em> was likely
chosen because it meant ‘devil’ in Romanian.</p>
<p>The novel’s narrative and action is unique, not featuring a single
protagonist. The main course of action is related through fictional
letters, diary entries, and newspaper articles, and focuses on the
Transylvanian nobleman Count Dracula’s vampire plague. As is the case
with many Gothic novels, <em>Dracula</em> features a considerable number
of common Gothic themes and motifs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heightened emotions</strong><br />
The majority of the characters are increasingly helpless and terrified
as the story progresses.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mystery and suspense</strong><br />
In relation to the previous motif, this results in offering the reader
state of suspense. Furthermore, Count Dracula remains hidden throughout
most of the story, the cause of vampires being unknown.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Damsel in distress</strong><br />
Lucy Westenra (one of the novel’s characters) follows the <em>damsel in
distress</em> archetype. The most innocent and pure of the girls, she
becomes a vampire (a member of the undead) after Count Dracula takes
hold of her.</li>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797 – 1851) was an English novelist
known for having written the Gothic novel <em>Frankenstein</em>,
inspired by her stay at George Byron’s villa on the lake of Geneva.
Shelley’s literary career was fruitful, having written many works of
considerable success and edited the poems of her husband, Percy Shelley,
a Romantic poet.</p>
<h4 id="frankenstein"><em>Frankenstein</em></h4>
<p><em>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</em>, is a Gothic novel
written by Mary Shelley and published in the year 1818. The novel was
inspired by her trip along with Percy (her husband) and Claire
Clairmont<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> at George Byron’s villa in Geneva
after he proposed a writing competition for the best ghost story to pass
the time they were spending indoors due to bad weather.</p>
<p>It tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young and ambitious
scientist, master of alchemy, chemistry, and electricity, who realizes
and unorthodox science experiment, creating a sapient creature from the
body parts of the dead (later referred to as “Frankenstein’s monster),
and Victor’s subsequent downfall and demise due to refusing to create a
female companion for the creature. The novel surprises the reader
through its macabre scenes and descriptions, its philosophical stance on
humanity’s condition, and Frankenstein’s monster himself.</p>
<p>Shelley’s novel presents many of the core elements of Gothic fiction,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presence of the Supernatural</strong><br />
From Victor’s obsession with alchemy, to the creation and awakening of
Frankenstein’s monster, the novel’s plot relies heavily on the
supernatural.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Corpses</strong><br />
From the beginning, corpses are prevalent throughout the story. The
creature is created from the remnants of dead bodies harvested by Victor
from grave-robbing, creating a terrifying and grotesque image. Victor’s
indifference and cold demeanor also represents his detachment from
humanity and subsequent descent into darkness.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong><br />
Most of the novel takes place at night, during moonless or stormy
nights. Victor’s creature must be powered using the energy of a shock
from a thunderstorm in order to bring him to life. Furthermore, when the
creature awakens, Victor can only see him “by the light of the moon”,
further emphasizing the darkness of the monster.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Loneliness and Isolation</strong><br />
Both the protagonist (Victor Frankenstein) and Frankenstein’s monster
can be characterized by their loneliness and life in isolation.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Secret and Mystery</strong><br />
A key element of Gothic literature is the presence of secrets.
Frankenstein’s secret is unique in that it is not a simple, static
secret that awaits to be uncovered, but a living, breathing thing, that
will reveal itself.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Destruction of Family</strong><br />
Families rarely remain intact in Gothic fiction. Frankenstein is no
different in that Victor’s entire family and even his friends end up
murdered by the monster.</li>
</ul>
<p>The novel’s subtitle, <em>The Modern Prometheus</em>, relates to the
first philosophical idea it unravels: a modern rendition of the myth of
Prometheus, who was a Titan in Greek mythology attributed with the
creation of making from clay. Likewise, being a creation myth,
<em>Frankenstein</em> delves into many biblical themes, such as the
creation of Adam and the origin of <em>Good</em> and <em>Evil</em>.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other, and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I
ought to be thy <em>Adam</em>; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom
thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which
I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”</em></div>
<p>Another theme tackled by the novel is that of defying nature’s laws
and Natural Order. In realizing his experiment, Victor can be considered
to have infringed God’s design for life, creating a living being by
himself.</p>
