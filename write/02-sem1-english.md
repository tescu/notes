:::

The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing and, perhaps, most well known
periods of English history, being a period characterised by its contradictions,
moral uncertainty, and prejudice. The period was named after Queen Victoria
(1819 -- 1901), whose reign of 63 years and 216 days defined the Victorian
era as a whole, being longer than any of her predecessors.

The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the rising
interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a widening horizon
due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably, Queen Victoria was the
first empress of India). These changes and discoveries, in turn, drastically
transformed the lives of English people, common folk and nobility alike.

## Victorian Ethos and Society

Life in Victorian England was deeply impacted by the introduction of what
was known as _social classes_, centered around the idea of structuring
the British society in an hierarchical order, based on the peoples' wealth,
social status, and sometimes even their family roots. The people of England
were split into three main classes:

1. __The working class__
    - This is the most separated group from the other classes. People born
    in this class faced the worst living conditions and the highest amount
    of prejudice, being forced to a life of cruel labor and poverty. Many
    of the working class would die from starvation or sickness, due to the
    nature of their work and poverty. It was very improbable for anyone born
    in this class to advance up the social ladder, or become respected in the
    upper classes.\
    As the name implies, the _working class_ was the social group that were
    occupied with manual labor. Not only men were forced to physical labor,
    but also the women and children, most often in places like factories or
    halls, with little regard to their hygiene, health, or general well-being.
2. __The middle class__
    - This is the group of people that had a stable financial income and could
    afford some of the luxuries available during the Victorian times, but were
    not part of the aristrocacy of the higher class. Many of the members of this
    class were hard workers, usually dealing with the more intellectual side
    of work, such as accounting, law, commerce or, more rarely, even by writing.\
    It was, at times, possible for people of the working class to work their way
    up into the middle class. One such example is the infamous Victorian writer,
    Charles Dickens, who spent most of his childhood working at a factory, but
    managed to gain a considerable fortune in his adult years working as a writer
    and journalist.
3. __The upper class__
    - Most of the members of the upper class were born as such due to family
    connections or bloodline from a royal family. These people held the highest
    social status in England, and were usually the wealthiest, owning a lot of
    land or businesses. They were also the people to hold the highest political
    power of the time and, as such, the lower classes would very rarely get in
    contact with any of their members.
    
## Victorian Literature

Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in, most of Victorian
literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour, and witful stories.
These comical works served as a way for the writers to express their distaste
with the way that British society had evolved, while also being of great value
to the common reader, who began to felt noticed and appreciated, and could
relate to the stories and challenges faced by many of the characters found in
such tales. The most popular of these works are, by far, Charles Dickens' semi-
autobiographical novels. (see chapter [Charles Dickens](#charles-dickens)).

:::

Charles Dickens (1812 -- 1870) was an English novelist, journalist, and
social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical novels,
commonly refered to as _"social novels"_, due to the social themes that are
scattered throughout his work. Dickens' literary output greatly influenced many
other English authors and is still enjoyed by critics and readers well into our
current era, with novels like _A Christmas Carol_ enjoying modern adaptations
into film, musicals, and children's cartoons.

Charles Dickens was born into a poor family but enjoyed relatively decent living
conditions during the first years of his life. However, things took a turn for
the worse after he turned 12 years old, when his father was arrested and sent to
prison, due to not being able to pay his taxes on time. For young Dickens, this
meant having to quit school and start doing manual labor in order to sustain his
poor family. Thus, young Dickens had to work in a very poor factory with severely
unsanitary working conditions. Lamentably so, child labor was very common during
the Victorian Age, and consequently, during Dickens' time. His childhood experiences
served as the base for his writings, having greatly impacted his way of thinking
and ethics.

Dickens began his writing career while he was still a teenager, and gradually
started going up the social ladder from his modest income. His writing was an
almost instant hit in England, largely due to the auto-biographical elements
that captivated readers, and the ethical themes tackled in his stories. His novels
are commonly referred to as _social novels_, and indeed the social inequality
and ethical problems of Victorian England shown in Dickens' novels were highly
influential during his time, since most of his readers could relate to the suffering
and injustice faced by his characters. Two of his most popular novels, _Great
Expectations_ and _David Copperfield_ were directly inspired by his childhood.

One of Charles Dickens' novels that best encompasses his writing style is the
aforementioned _David Copperfied_. The novel is a bildungsroman (a coming of age
story), closely following the life of the eponymous character, David Copperfield,
from his early childhood well into his maturity. This is, perhaps, the novel where
the autobiographical elements of Dicken's writing can be seen the most.
Starting with the main character's name, which matches the author's own initials
(D.C. and C.D.), to his calm demeanor and personality, and his path to becomming
a successful writer. In fact, Dickens affirms in his own words that this novel
had a very special place in his heart, declaring:

| _'Of all my books, I like this the best.'_

Charles Dickens' contributions to English literature greatly influenced the rising
popularity of the novel as a literary form that can be enjoyed by the masses. His
social and ethical themes also paved the way to shaping the opinions and ideas of
many of his readers, greatly contributing to raising awareness among people of the
higher classes regarding the greatly disturbing living conditions of those of the
lower class.

# The Victorian Novel and Novelists

## W. M. Thackeray

:::
William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 -- 1863) was an English novelist and illustrator
most appreciated for his satirical works. He was born in Calcutta[^k], in Brittish
India, and moved to England after his father's death in 1815. His background having
been born into one of the territories under colonial rule of England has greatly
influenced his work, as can be seen in his novel _Vanity Fair_, a satire novel
criticizing 19th century British society.

Thackeray first started writing while working for a few newspapers, and later chose
to write books as his primary source of income, publishing under a number of pseudonyms.
His first novels were satires and parodies, but his first successful and most popular
work was _Vanity Fair_, published in monthly parts from 1847 to 1848, under his real
name. The choice to publish in a serial format was likely inspired by Charles Dickens'
success in using this method of publishing. Thackeray's _Vanity Fair_ was, by far,
his most successful work, with critics placing him second only to Charles Dickens during
his lifetime.

_Vanity Fair_ is a satirical novel largely mocking of English society during Victorian
times. The work stands out because of its satirisation of 19th century British societal
norms, as can be noticed from its two subtitles, first published with the subtitle
_Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society_, then republished as a single volume with
the subtitle _A novel without a hero_, hinting at its sarcastic nature.
The novel is written like a puppet play and is one of the first examples of an _unreliable_
narrator in English literature.  

The novel draws a great deal of inspiration from two sources, the first being John
Bunyan's _A Pilgrim's Progress'_, from which Thackeray took the concept of a never-ending
fair taking place in a town called _Vanity_, and the second being the book of _Ecclesiastes_
from the Bible. The elements taken from Ecclesiastes are most apparent in the novel's
conclusion, where Thackeray adapts the Latin Vulgate quote -- _'Vanitas vanitatum'_, i.e.
_'Vanities of vanities! All is futile!'_ -- and uses it to describe the irony of vain
worldy ambitions and desires: _'Ah! Vanitas Vanitatum! Which of us is happy in this world?
Which of us has desire, or having it, is satisfied?'_.

William Thackeray's _Vanity Fair_ stands out as an impressive novel of great proportions,
encompassing an irreplaceable commentary on the society and mores[^more], and featuring
a masterful usage of the English language to convey a subtle, yet impactful read.
The novel is one of the earliest examples of an _unreliable narrator_ in English literature.
It features a considerable number of innovations in expressivity and description, and many
of its quotes and wordplays have become famous, such as the play on words of the novel's
title: _'All is vanity, nothing is fair'._

[^k]: Calcutta was a part of British India, in what is now the modern-day city of Kolkata, India.

[^more]: From Latin _mõres_, plural only. A set of normal norms or customs in a society.

## The Brontë Sisters

clutter the picture.
:::

The Brontë Sisters were, as the name implies, a group of sisters from the Brontë
family, all of whom were novelists and poets, and had a deep passion for the arts
and literature. Their brother, Branwell, was a talented painter. The sisters
-- Charlotte, Emily, and Anne -- all have written astonishing works, which were
published their works under male pseudonyms in order to avoid scrutiny from readers
and/or critics. These pseudonyms were taken from their initials, and were intentionally
bland: __Currer Bell__, __Ellis Bell__, and __Acton Bell__.

The Brontë sisters were some of the most influential figures in English literature,
making astonishing contributions to its development and popularisation. Their works
and tragic life stories, characterized by illness and unfulfilled aspirations, had
a profound impact on Victorian society and thought. Two of the novels written by the
sisters are most widely acclaimed by critics for thier literary value, namely _Jane Eyre_
by Charlotte Brontë, and _Wuthering Heights_ by Emily Brontë. 

### Emily Brontë

Emily Brontë (1818 -- 1848) was the fifth of the six Brontë siblings, of whom only
four survived into adulthood. Her only novel, _Wuthering Heights_, published in 1847,
under the pen name __Ellis Bell__ is commonly considered one of the greatest novels
written in English. Very little is known of Emily's personal life, since she left
behind only a small number of correspondence and lived a rather quiet and reserved
life. Her novels suggest that she lived a relatively peaceful life, but she was sadly
affected by frequent sprouts of illness, particularly tuberculosis, which ultimately
claimed her life at the age of only 30. Although it is not known how much time Emily 
spent writing her novel, the sheer amount of detail and its solid framework indicate
that it was lengthy process.

_Wuthering Heights_ is one of the most popular novels of English literature and regarded
by many as a genuine British classic. The novel takes elements from both the Romantic
and Gothic movements, which preceded her time period, but leans in especially towards
more Gothic themes.

Emily Brontë shares much of her sisters' dry humour and, particularly, Charlotte's
violent imagination in storytelling. However, Emily is much more reserved when it
comes to taking inspiration from her personal life, and shows no aspirations for
a higher position in society.

### Charlotte Brontë

Charlotte Brontë (1816 -- 1855) was the elder sister of the Emily and Anne. Her most
known work is the novel _Jane Eyre_, published in the year 1848 under her pseudonym
__Currer Bell__. Unlike Emily, a lot more is known about her personal life, having
left a huge number of letters. Charlotte had a dream of starting a school for children,
but health and monetary problems sadly stopped her from ever reaching this dream.
She married Arthur Bell Nicholas, an Irishman and her fourth suitor[^suitor], on June
29, 1854. Although her husband was not as ambitious or passionate about intellectual
matters, she was content to be his loving wife. During this time, she began work on
_Emma_, but her pregnancy and subsequent health complications left her too unwell to
continue writing. She died aged 38 in 1855. 

[^suitor]: It was common practice, during Victorian times, for men who were seeking
the affection or hand in marriage of a woman to partake in courting. Such men were
called _suitors_ and would show their interest through formal visits, gifts, and polite
conversation. Courtship was a central part of Victorian etiquette, and suitors were
expected to be very polite and respectful towards their love interest.

Charlotte's novels paved the way for further refinement of the Victorian social novels,
featuring many themes and motifs typical of the genre. Her works had a particularly strong
influence on contemporary readers and critics, especially _Jane Eyre_, whose narrative of
a woman conflicted between her social status and her natural desires struck a chord with
the public.

## George Eliot

:::

George Eliot (1819 -- 1880), under her real name, Marry Ann Evans, was an English
novelist, journalist, and poet. She has written seven novels in total, the most
popular of which are _Adam Bede_ (1859), _Middlemarch_ (1871), and
_The Mill on the Floss_ (1860). Most of her novels were published under her pseudonym,
and tipically in a serial format, much like Charles Dickens and Thackeray. She also
translated a number of works from Italian, Latin, and German, and was fond of philosophy
and science.

Much like Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, she faced quite precarious living conditions
during her childhood and was of humble origins. Her life in the countryside was most
likely one of her greater influences in her writings, as most of her novels feature
detailed descriptions of rural England.

Critics admired Eliot's works for their realism and psychological elements, as well
as the aforementioned descriptions of the countryside. George Eliot's works were one
of the key elements in popularizing the use of literary realism across a diverse number
of authors, including her contemporaries.

George Eliot was a rather controversial figure of her times, challenging many of the
moral and social taboos of Victorian England. Of her controversies, her relationship
with George Henry Lewes, a married man, sparked the most outrage and was considered
scandalous. Eliot lived with Lewes up until his death, and then married her longtime
friend, John Cross, 18 months after. She, however, died only a few months after her
marriage, in December 1880.



### Middlemarch
_Middlemarch_ is George Eliot's most popular novel. The novel was serialised in eight
volumes from 1871 to 1872, and was published with the subtitle _'A Study of Provincial Life'_.

### Adam Bede

### Literary realism

## Thomas Hardy

:::image
![Thomas Hardy in 1894](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Thomas-Hardy.jpg/500px-Thomas-Hardy.jpg)
::::

Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928) was an English novelist and poet, best known for his
famous social novel, _Tess of d'Urbervilles_, largely disputed at the time of its
publishing due to the way in which it depicted the crude hardships faced by women
during Victorian times. His novels fit into two main themes: Realism, most noticeable
in his novels, and Romanticism, most apparent in his poetry. His literary output was
quite regular throughout his career, beginning with his first published novel,
_Desperate Remedies_ in 1871, and continuing to produce many others in the years after:
_The Return of the Native_ (1878), _The Trumpet_ (1880), _The Mayor of Casterbridge_
(1886), _The Woodlanders_ (1887), and finally _Tess of d'Urbervilles_ (1891).

Hardy's works have been profoundly influenced by the contrast between his own
chilhood living in a quiet rural village in Higher Bockhampton, and the busy life of
London, where he worked from 1862 as a draftsman, designing and restoring churches.
Despite his upbringing into the Anglican Church and work, Hardy was most likely an
agnostic, influenced by the growing unease of Victorian society, and works of Charles
Darwin and others. His pessimism and his belief that humans are destined to live a corrupt
and malign fate led him to reject the consolation of Christianity and adopt a materialist
point of view. Consequently, much of Hardy’s literary output is characterised by his
rejection of optimism and his embrace of dark realism, as is evident in the hopeless
yet pitiful character of his novels and poetry. 

While being generally regarded as a novelist by most critics, Hardy considered
himself fundamentally a poet. His first novel, _The Poor Man and the Lady_ was ill
received and rejected by all the publishers he contacted, leading to it never being
published. The manuscript was destroyed by Hardy in his later years and no copies of
it exist. His later works, however, were of moderate success, and his most successful
work, _Tess of d'Urbervilles_, captivated critics due to its heavy use of _realism_.
The author examines many of the aspects of peoples' lives during Victorian times, and
harshly criticizes the strict beliefs and hypocrisy which defined this era. His writings
and ideas have also been deeply influenced by the works of John Stuart Mill, an English
philosopher, social reformer and politician.

Hardy's poetry was largely inspired by the Romantic movement, particularly the poetry
of William Wordsworth. His poetry generally features themes regarding the cruelty of
life, the pathos of men, and the tragic irony of circumstance, oftentimes leaning into
an image of unjust destiny. His poetic art is quite concise, but stands out due to its
intense emotion:

| _'Has some Vast Imbecility_
|   _Mighty to build and blend_
|   _But important to tend,_
| _Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry?'_<br/>
| (_Nature's Questioning_)
