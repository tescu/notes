# The Victorian Age

The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing periods of English history,
being in itself a period of contradictions, moral uncertainty, and prejudice.
Its name comes from the reign of Queen Victoria (1819 -- 1901), whose reign of
63 years and 216 days defined the Victorian era as a whole, outlasting that of
any of her predecessors.

The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the rising
interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a widening horizon
due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably, Queen Victoria was the
first empress of India). These changes and discoveries, in turn, drastically
transformed the lives of English people, common folk and nobility alike.

## Victorian Ethos and Society

As mentioned above, the Victorian era is, perhaps, best described by its
contradictions, the stark contrast between what was considered socially
adequate and proper, and what many people faced and saw.

## Victorian Literature

Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in, Victorian
Literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour, and witfulness.
These comical works served as a way for the writers to express their distaste
with the way that British society had evolved, while also being of great value
to the common reader, who began to felt noticed and appreciated, and could
relate to the stories and challenges faced by many of the characters found in
such tales. The most popular of these works are, by far, Charles Dickens' semi-
autobiographical novels. (see chapter [Charles Dickens](#charles dickens)).

# Charles Dickens

Charles Dickens (1812 -- 1870) was an English novelist and journalist, and
social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical novels,
commonly refered to as _"social novels"_, due to the social themes that are
scattered throughout his work. Dickens' literary output greatly influenced many
other English authors and is still enjoyed by critics and readers well into our
current era, with novels like _A Christmas Carol_ enjoying modern adaptations
into film, musicals, and children's cartoons.
