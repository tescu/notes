# The Victorian Age

The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing periods of English history,
being in itself a period of contradictions, moral uncertainty, and prejudice.
Its name comes from the reign of Queen Victoria (1819 -- 1901), whose reign of
63 years and 216 days defined the Victorian era as a whole, outlasting that of
any of her predecessors.

The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the rising
interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a widening horizon
due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably, Queen Victoria was the
first empress of India). These changes and discoveries, in turn, drastically
transformed the lives of English people, common folk and nobility alike.

## Victorian Ethos and Society

As mentioned above, the Victorian era is, perhaps, best described by its
contradictions, the stark contrast between what was considered socially
adequate and proper, and what many people faced and saw.

## Victorian Literature

Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in, Victorian
Literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour, and witfulness.
These comical works served as a way for the writers to express their distaste
with the way that British society had evolved, while also being of great value
to the common reader, who began to felt noticed and appreciated, and could
relate to the stories and challenges faced by many of the characters found in
such tales. The most popular of these works are, by far, Charles Dickens' semi-
autobiographical novels. (see chapter [Charles Dickens](#charles-dickens)).

# Victorian Writers and Poets

## Alfred Lord Tennyson

## Robert Browning

## Gerard Manley Hopkins

## The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood or _The Raphaelites_ were a group of artists
founded in the year 1848.

# Charles Dickens

Charles Dickens (1812 -- 1870) was an English novelist and journalist, and
social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical novels,
commonly refered to as _"social novels"_, due to the social themes that are
scattered throughout his work. Dickens' literary output greatly influenced many
other English authors and is still enjoyed by critics and readers well into our
current era, with novels like _A Christmas Carol_ enjoying modern adaptations
into film, musicals, and children's cartoons.

# The Victorian Novel and Novelists

## W. M. Thackeray
William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 -- 1863) was an English novelist and illustrator
most appreciated for his satirical works. He was born in Calcutta[^k], in Brittish
India, and moved to England after his father's death in 1815. His background having
been born into one of the territories under colonial rule of England has greatly
influenced his work, as can be seen in his novel _Vanity Fair_, a satire novel
criticizing 19th century British society.

## The Brontë Sisters
The Brontë Sisters were, as the name implies, a group of sisters from the Brontë
family, all of whom were novelists and poets. The sisters -- Charlotte, Emily, and
Anne -- all had published their works under male pseudonyms taken from their initials
in order to avoid scrutiny from readers and critics: __Currer Bell__, __Ellis Bell__,
and __Acton Bell__.

Two novels written by the sisters are most widely acclaimed by critics for thier
literary value, namely _Jane Eyre_ by Charlotte Brontë, and _Wuthering Heights_ by
Emily Brontë.

### Emily Brontë
Emily Brontë (1818 -- 1848) was the fifth of the six Brontë siblings, of whom only
four survived into adulthood. Her only novel, _Wuthering Heights_, published in 1847,
under the pen name __Ellis Bell__ is commonly considered one of the greatest novels
written in English.

### Charlotte Brontë
Charlotte Brontë (1816 -- 1855) was the elder sister of the Emily and Anne. Her most
known work is the novel _Jane Eyre_, published in the year 1848 under her pseudonym
__Currer Bell__.

## George Eliot
George Eliot (1819 -- 1880), under her real name, Marry Ann Evans, was an English
novelist, journalist, and poet. She has written seven novels in total, the most
popular of which are _Adam Bede_ (1859), _Middlemarch_ (1871), and
_The Mill on the Floss_ (1860).
George Eliot's works popularised the use of literary realism across a diverse number
of authors, including her contemporaries.

### Middlemarch
_Middlemarch_ is George Eliot's most popular novel. The novel was serialised in eight
volumes from 1871 to 1872, and was published with the subtitle
_"A Study of Provincial Life"_

### Adam Bede

### Literary realism

## Thomas Hardy

Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928) was an English novelist and poet, best known for his
famous social novel, _Tess of d'Urbervilles_, largely disputed at the time of its
publishing due to the way in which it depicted the crude hardships faced by women
during Victorian times. His novels fit into two main themes: Realism and Romanticism.

Hardy's works have been profoundly influenced by the contrast between his own
chilhood living in a quiet rural village in Higher Bockhampton, and the busy life of
London, where he worked from 1862 as a draftsman, designing and restoring churches.

Despite being generally regarded as a novelist by most critics, Hardy considered
himself fundamentally a poet. His first novel, _The Poor Man and the Lady_ was ill
received and rejected by all the publishers he contacted, leading to it never being
published. The manuscript was destroyed by Hardy in his later years and no copies of
it exist.
