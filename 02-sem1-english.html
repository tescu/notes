<p>The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing and, perhaps, most
well known periods of English history, being a period characterised by
its contradictions, moral uncertainty, and prejudice. The period was
named after Queen Victoria (1819 – 1901), whose reign of 63 years and
216 days defined the Victorian era as a whole, being longer than any of
her predecessors.</p>
<p>The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the
rising interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a
widening horizon due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably,
Queen Victoria was the first empress of India). These changes and
discoveries, in turn, drastically transformed the lives of English
people, common folk and nobility alike.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-ethos-and-society">Victorian Ethos and Society</h2>
<p>Life in Victorian England was deeply impacted by the introduction of
what was known as <em>social classes</em>, centered around the idea of
structuring the British society in an hierarchical order, based on the
peoples’ wealth, social status, and sometimes even their family roots.
The people of England were split into three main classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The working class</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the most separated group from the other classes. People born
in this class faced the worst living conditions and the highest amount
of prejudice, being forced to a life of cruel labor and poverty. Many of
the working class would die from starvation or sickness, due to the
nature of their work and poverty. It was very improbable for anyone born
in this class to advance up the social ladder, or become respected in
the upper classes.<br />
As the name implies, the <em>working class</em> was the social group
that were occupied with manual labor. Not only men were forced to
physical labor, but also the women and children, most often in places
like factories or halls, with little regard to their hygiene, health, or
general well-being.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The middle class</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the group of people that had a stable financial income and
could afford some of the luxuries available during the Victorian times,
but were not part of the aristrocacy of the higher class. Many of the
members of this class were hard workers, usually dealing with the more
intellectual side of work, such as accounting, law, commerce or, more
rarely, even by writing.<br />
It was, at times, possible for people of the working class to work their
way up into the middle class. One such example is the infamous Victorian
writer, Charles Dickens, who spent most of his childhood working at a
factory, but managed to gain a considerable fortune in his adult years
working as a writer and journalist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The upper class</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the members of the upper class were born as such due to
family connections or bloodline from a royal family. These people held
the highest social status in England, and were usually the wealthiest,
owning a lot of land or businesses. They were also the people to hold
the highest political power of the time and, as such, the lower classes
would very rarely get in contact with any of their members.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="victorian-literature">Victorian Literature</h2>
<p>Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in, most of
Victorian literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour,
and witful stories. These comical works served as a way for the writers
to express their distaste with the way that British society had evolved,
while also being of great value to the common reader, who began to felt
noticed and appreciated, and could relate to the stories and challenges
faced by many of the characters found in such tales. The most popular of
these works are, by far, Charles Dickens’ semi- autobiographical novels.

<p>Charles Dickens (1812 – 1870) was an English novelist, journalist,
and social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical
novels, commonly refered to as <em>“social novels”</em>, due to the
social themes that are scattered throughout his work. Dickens’ literary
output greatly influenced many other English authors and is still
enjoyed by critics and readers well into our current era, with novels
like <em>A Christmas Carol</em> enjoying modern adaptations into film,
musicals, and children’s cartoons.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was born into a poor family but enjoyed relatively
decent living conditions during the first years of his life. However,
things took a turn for the worse after he turned 12 years old, when his
father was arrested and sent to prison, due to not being able to pay his
taxes on time. For young Dickens, this meant having to quit school and
start doing manual labor in order to sustain his poor family. Thus,
young Dickens had to work in a very poor factory with severely
unsanitary working conditions. Lamentably so, child labor was very
common during the Victorian Age, and consequently, during Dickens’ time.
His childhood experiences served as the base for his writings, having
greatly impacted his way of thinking and ethics.</p>
<p>Dickens began his writing career while he was still a teenager, and
gradually started going up the social ladder from his modest income. His
writing was an almost instant hit in England, largely due to the
auto-biographical elements that captivated readers, and the ethical
themes tackled in his stories. His novels are commonly referred to as
<em>social novels</em>, and indeed the social inequality and ethical
problems of Victorian England shown in Dickens’ novels were highly
influential during his time, since most of his readers could relate to
the suffering and injustice faced by his characters. Two of his most
popular novels, <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>David
Copperfield</em> were directly inspired by his childhood.</p>
<p>One of Charles Dickens’ novels that best encompasses his writing
style is the aforementioned <em>David Copperfied</em>. The novel is a
bildungsroman (a coming of age story), closely following the life of the
eponymous character, David Copperfield, from his early childhood well
into his maturity. This is, perhaps, the novel where the
autobiographical elements of Dicken’s writing can be seen the most.
Starting with the main character’s name, which matches the author’s own
initials (D.C. and C.D.), to his calm demeanor and personality, and his
path to becomming a successful writer. In fact, Dickens affirms in his
own words that this novel had a very special place in his heart,
declaring:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>‘Of all my books, I like this the
best.’</em></div>
<p>Charles Dickens’ contributions to English literature greatly
influenced the rising popularity of the novel as a literary form that
can be enjoyed by the masses. His social and ethical themes also paved
the way to shaping the opinions and ideas of many of his readers,
greatly contributing to raising awareness among people of the higher
classes regarding the greatly disturbing living conditions of those of
the lower class.</p>

</div>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 – 1863) was an English novelist and
illustrator most appreciated for his satirical works. He was born in
Calcutta<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in Brittish India, and moved to
England after his father’s death in 1815. His background having been
born into one of the territories under colonial rule of England has
greatly influenced his work, as can be seen in his novel <em>Vanity
Fair</em>, a satire novel criticizing 19th century British society.</p>
<p>Thackeray first started writing while working for a few newspapers,
and later chose to write books as his primary source of income,
publishing under a number of pseudonyms. His first novels were satires
and parodies, but his first successful and most popular work was
<em>Vanity Fair</em>, published in monthly parts from 1847 to 1848,
under his real name. The choice to publish in a serial format was likely
inspired by Charles Dickens’ success in using this method of publishing.
Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> was, by far, his most successful work,
with critics placing him second only to Charles Dickens during his
lifetime.</p>
<p><em>Vanity Fair</em> is a satirical novel largely mocking of English
society during Victorian times. The work stands out because of its
satirisation of 19th century British societal norms, as can be noticed
from its two subtitles, first published with the subtitle <em>Pen and
Pencil Sketches of English Society</em>, then republished as a single
volume with the subtitle <em>A novel without a hero</em>, hinting at its
sarcastic nature. The novel is written like a puppet play and is one of
the first examples of an <em>unreliable</em> narrator in English
literature.</p>
<p>The novel draws a great deal of inspiration from two sources, the
first being John Bunyan’s <em>A Pilgrim’s Progress’</em>, from which
Thackeray took the concept of a never-ending fair taking place in a town
called <em>Vanity</em>, and the second being the book of
<em>Ecclesiastes</em> from the Bible. The elements taken from
Ecclesiastes are most apparent in the novel’s conclusion, where
Thackeray adapts the Latin Vulgate quote – <em>‘Vanitas vanitatum’</em>,
i.e. <em>‘Vanities of vanities! All is futile!’</em> – and uses it to
describe the irony of vain worldy ambitions and desires: <em>‘Ah!
Vanitas Vanitatum! Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has
desire, or having it, is satisfied?’</em>.</p>
<p>William Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> stands out as an impressive
novel of great proportions, encompassing an irreplaceable commentary on
the society and mores<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and featuring a masterful usage of
the English language to convey a subtle, yet impactful read. The novel
is one of the earliest examples of an <em>unreliable narrator</em> in
English literature. It features a considerable number of innovations in
expressivity and description, and many of its quotes and wordplays have
become famous, such as the play on words of the novel’s title: <em>‘All
is vanity, nothing is fair’.</em></p>

</div>
<p>The Brontë Sisters were, as the name implies, a group of sisters from
the Brontë family, all of whom were novelists and poets, and had a deep
passion for the arts and literature. Their brother, Branwell, was a
talented painter. The sisters – Charlotte, Emily, and Anne – all have
written astonishing works, which were published their works under male
pseudonyms in order to avoid scrutiny from readers and/or critics. These
pseudonyms were taken from their initials, and were intentionally bland:
<strong>Currer Bell</strong>, <strong>Ellis Bell</strong>, and
<strong>Acton Bell</strong>.</p>
<p>The Brontë sisters were some of the most influential figures in
English literature, making astonishing contributions to its development
and popularisation. Their works and tragic life stories, characterized
by illness and unfulfilled aspirations, had a profound impact on
Victorian society and thought. Two of the novels written by the sisters
are most widely acclaimed by critics for thier literary value, namely
<em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Brontë, and <em>Wuthering Heights</em>
by Emily Brontë.</p>
<h3 id="emily-brontë">Emily Brontë</h3>
<p>Emily Brontë (1818 – 1848) was the fifth of the six Brontë siblings,
of whom only four survived into adulthood. Her only novel, <em>Wuthering
Heights</em>, published in 1847, under the pen name <strong>Ellis
Bell</strong> is commonly considered one of the greatest novels written
in English. Very little is known of Emily’s personal life, since she
left behind only a small number of correspondence and lived a rather
quiet and reserved life. Her novels suggest that she lived a relatively
peaceful life, but she was sadly affected by frequent sprouts of
illness, particularly tuberculosis, which ultimately claimed her life at
the age of only 30. Although it is not known how much time Emily spent
writing her novel, the sheer amount of detail and its solid framework
indicate that it was lengthy process.</p>
<p><em>Wuthering Heights</em> is one of the most popular novels of
English literature and regarded by many as a genuine British classic.
The novel takes elements from both the Romantic and Gothic movements,
which preceded her time period, but leans in especially towards more
Gothic themes.</p>
<p>Emily Brontë shares much of her sisters’ dry humour and,
particularly, Charlotte’s violent imagination in storytelling. However,
Emily is much more reserved when it comes to taking inspiration from her
personal life, and shows no aspirations for a higher position in
society.</p>

</div>
<p>Charlotte Brontë (1816 – 1855) was the elder sister of the Emily and
Anne. Her most known work is the novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, published in
the year 1848 under her pseudonym <strong>Currer Bell</strong>. Unlike
Emily, a lot more is known about her personal life, having left a huge
number of letters. Charlotte had a dream of starting a school for
children, but health and monetary problems sadly stopped her from ever
reaching this dream.</p>
<p>She married Arthur Bell Nicholas, an Irishman and her fourth suitor<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, on June 29, 1854. Although her
husband was not as ambitious or passionate about intellectual matters,
she was content to be his loving wife. During this time, she began work
on <em>Emma</em>, but her pregnancy and subsequent health complications
left her too unwell to continue writing. She died aged 38 in 1855.</p>
<p>Many of the themes present in Charlotte’s work were undoubtedly taken
from her own life experiences, mixed with a mesmerising and dynamic
imagination. While ultimately realistic in style, her novels show a
great inclination towards raw honesty in portraying her characters’
dreams and desires, and are capable of inducing a feeling of suspense
and mystery in the reader.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s novels paved the way for further refinement of the
Victorian social novels, featuring many themes and motifs typical of the
genre. Her works had a particularly strong influence on contemporary
readers and critics, especially <em>Jane Eyre</em>, whose narrative of a
woman conflicted between her social status and her natural desires
struck a chord with the public. The novel is a bildungsroman following
the life of the eponymous character, Jane, as she grows into adulthood
and falls in love with Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. It was one of
the first novels to revolutionise English-language prose fiction,
focusing intesely on the interior thoughts and moral and spiritual
development of the main character, all of which is narrated in the first
person to highlighting the character’s emotional state. The book can
also be considered a <em>social novel</em> due to its strong elements of
social criticism and Christian morality, while also taking an
individualistic stance on Jane’s character. The novel was an instant
success after its publishing, and has posthumously become a classic of
English literature that continues to be read and enjoyed by many readers
even in our times.</p>

<p>George Eliot (1819 – 1880), under her real name, Marry Ann Evans, was
an English novelist, journalist, and poet. She has written seven novels
in total, the most popular of which are <em>Adam Bede</em> (1859),
<em>Middlemarch</em> (1871), and <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> (1860).
Most of her novels were published under her pseudonym, and typically in
a serial format, much like Charles Dickens and Thackeray. She also
translated a number of works from Italian, Latin, and German, and was
fond of philosophy and science.</p>
<p>Much like Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, she faced quite
precarious living conditions during her childhood and was of humble
origins. Her life in the countryside was most likely one of her greater
influences in her writings, as most of her novels feature detailed
descriptions of rural England.</p>
<p>Critics admired Eliot’s works for their realism and psychological
elements, as well as the aforementioned descriptions of the countryside.
George Eliot’s works were one of the key elements in popularizing the
use of literary realism across a diverse number of authors, including
her contemporaries.</p>
<p>George Eliot was a rather controversial figure of her times,
challenging many of the moral and social taboos of Victorian England. Of
her controversies, her relationship with George Henry Lewes, a married
man, sparked the most outrage and was considered scandalous. Eliot lived
with Lewes up until his death, and then married her longtime friend,
John Cross, 18 months after. She, however, died only a few months after
her marriage, in December 1880.</p>
<h3 id="middlemarch">Middlemarch</h3>
<p><em>Middlemarch</em> is George Eliot’s most popular novel. The novel
was serialised in eight volumes from 1871 to 1872, and was published
with the subtitle <em>‘A Study of Provincial Life’</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Thomas Hardy (1840 – 1928) was an English novelist and poet, best
known for his famous social novel, <em>Tess of d’Urbervilles</em>,
largely disputed at the time of its publishing due to the way in which
it depicted the crude hardships faced by women during Victorian times.
His novels fit into two main themes: Realism, most noticeable in his
novels, and Romanticism, most apparent in his poetry. His literary
output was quite regular throughout his career, beginning with his first
published novel, <em>Desperate Remedies</em> in 1871, and continuing to
produce many others in the years after: <em>The Return of the
Native</em> (1878), <em>The Trumpet</em> (1880), <em>The Mayor of
Casterbridge</em> (1886), <em>The Woodlanders</em> (1887), and finally
<em>Tess of d’Urbervilles</em> (1891).</p>
<p>Hardy’s works have been profoundly influenced by the contrast between
his own chilhood living in a quiet rural village in Higher Bockhampton,
and the busy life of London, where he worked from 1862 as a draftsman,
designing and restoring churches. Despite his upbringing into the
Anglican Church and work, Hardy was most likely an agnostic, influenced
by the growing unease of Victorian society, and works of Charles Darwin
and others. His pessimism and his belief that humans are destined to
live a corrupt and malign fate led him to reject the consolation of
Christianity and adopt a materialist point of view. Consequently, much
of Hardy’s literary output is characterised by his rejection of optimism
and his embrace of dark realism, as is evident in the hopeless yet
pitiful character of his novels and poetry.</p>
<p>While being generally regarded as a novelist by most critics, Hardy
considered himself fundamentally a poet. His first novel, <em>The Poor
Man and the Lady</em> was ill received and rejected by all the
publishers he contacted, leading to it never being published. The
manuscript was destroyed by Hardy in his later years and no copies of it
exist. His later works, however, were of moderate success, and his most
successful work, <em>Tess of d’Urbervilles</em>, captivated critics due
to its heavy use of <em>realism</em>. The author examines many of the
aspects of peoples’ lives during Victorian times, and harshly criticizes
the strict beliefs and hypocrisy which defined this era. His writings
and ideas have also been deeply influenced by the works of John Stuart
Mill, an English philosopher, social reformer and politician.</p>
<p>Hardy’s poetry was largely inspired by the Romantic movement,
particularly the poetry of William Wordsworth. His poetry generally
features themes regarding the cruelty of life, the pathos of men, and
the tragic irony of circumstance, oftentimes leaning into an image of
unjust destiny. His poetic art is quite concise, but stands out due to
its intense emotion:</p>
