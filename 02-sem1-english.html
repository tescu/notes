<h1 id="the-victorian-age">The Victorian Age</h1>
<p>The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing periods of English
history, being in itself a period of contradictions, moral uncertainty,
and prejudice. Its name comes from the reign of Queen Victoria (1819 –
1901), whose reign of 63 years and 216 days defined the Victorian era as
a whole, outlasting that of any of her predecessors.</p>
<p>The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the
rising interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a
widening horizon due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably,
Queen Victoria was the first empress of India). These changes and
discoveries, in turn, drastically transformed the lives of English
people, common folk and nobility alike.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-ethos-and-society">Victorian Ethos and Society</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Victorian era is, perhaps, best described by
its contradictions, the stark contrast between what was considered
socially adequate and proper, and what many people faced and saw.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-literature">Victorian Literature</h2>
<p>Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in,
Victorian Literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour,
and witfulness. These comical works served as a way for the writers to
express their distaste with the way that British society had evolved,
while also being of great value to the common reader, who began to felt
noticed and appreciated, and could relate to the stories and challenges
faced by many of the characters found in such tales. The most popular of
these works are, by far, Charles Dickens’ semi- autobiographical novels.
(see chapter <a href="#charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</a>).</p>

<h2 id="robert-browning">Robert Browning</h2>
<h2 id="gerard-manley-hopkins">Gerard Manley Hopkins</h2>
<h2 id="the-pre-raphaelite-brotherhood">The Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood</h2>
<p>The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood or <em>The Raphaelites</em> were a
group of artists founded in the year 1848.</p>
<h1 id="charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</h1>
<p>Charles Dickens (1812 – 1870) was an English novelist and journalist,
and social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical
novels, commonly refered to as <em>“social novels”</em>, due to the
social themes that are scattered throughout his work. Dickens’ literary
output greatly influenced many other English authors and is still
enjoyed by critics and readers well into our current era, with novels
like <em>A Christmas Carol</em> enjoying modern adaptations into film,
musicals, and children’s cartoons.</p>

<h2 id="w.-m.-thackeray">W. M. Thackeray</h2>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 – 1863) was an English novelist and
illustrator most appreciated for his satirical works. He was born in
Calcutta<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in Brittish India, and moved to
England after his father’s death in 1815. His background having been
born into one of the territories under colonial rule of England has
greatly influenced his work, as can be seen in his novel <em>Vanity
Fair</em>, a satire novel criticizing 19th century British society.</p>
<h2 id="the-brontë-sisters">The Brontë Sisters</h2>
<p>The Brontë Sisters were, as the name implies, a group of sisters from
the Brontë family, all of whom were novelists and poets. The sisters –
Charlotte, Emily, and Anne – all had published their works under male
pseudonyms taken from their initials in order to avoid scrutiny from
readers and critics: <strong>Currer Bell</strong>, <strong>Ellis
Bell</strong>, and <strong>Acton Bell</strong>.</p>
<p>Two novels written by the sisters are most widely acclaimed by
critics for thier literary value, namely <em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte
Brontë, and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> by Emily Brontë.</p>
<h3 id="emily-brontë">Emily Brontë</h3>
<p>Emily Brontë (1818 – 1848) was the fifth of the six Brontë siblings,
of whom only four survived into adulthood. Her only novel, <em>Wuthering
Heights</em>, published in 1847, under the pen name <strong>Ellis
Bell</strong> is commonly considered one of the greatest novels written
in English.</p>
<h3 id="charlotte-brontë">Charlotte Brontë</h3>
<p>Charlotte Brontë (1816 – 1855) was the elder sister of the Emily and
Anne. Her most known work is the novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, published in
the year 1848 under her pseudonym <strong>Currer Bell</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="george-eliot">George Eliot</h2>
<p>George Eliot (1819 – 1880), under her real name, Marry Ann Evans, was
an English novelist, journalist, and poet. She has written seven novels
in total, the most popular of which are <em>Adam Bede</em> (1859),
<em>Middlemarch</em> (1871), and <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> (1860).
George Eliot’s works popularised the use of literary realism across a
diverse number of authors, including her contemporaries.</p>

<h2 id="thomas-hardy">Thomas Hardy</h2>
<p>Thomas Hardy (1840 – 1928) was an English novelist and poet, best
known for his famous social novel, <em>Tess of d’Urbervilles</em>,
largely disputed at the time of its publishing due to the way in which
it depicted the crude hardships faced by women during Victorian times.
His novels fit into two main themes: Realism and Romanticism.</p>
