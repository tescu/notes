<p>The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing and, perhaps, most
well known periods of English history, being a period characterised by
its contradictions, moral uncertainty, and prejudice. The period was
named after Queen Victoria (1819 – 1901), whose reign of 63 years and
216 days defined the Victorian era as a whole, being longer than any of
her predecessors.</p>
<p>The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the
rising interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a
widening horizon due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably,
Queen Victoria was the first empress of India). These changes and
discoveries, in turn, drastically transformed the lives of English
people, common folk and nobility alike.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-ethos-and-society">Victorian Ethos and Society</h2>
<p>Life in Victorian England was deeply impacted by the introduction of
what was known as <em>social classes</em>, centered around the idea of
structuring the British society in an hierarchical order, based on the
peoples’ wealth, social status, and sometimes even their family roots.
The people of England were split into three main classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The working class</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the most separated group from the other classes. People born
in this class faced the worst living conditions and the highest amount
of prejudice, being forced to a life of cruel labor and poverty. Many of
the working class would die from starvation or sickness, due to the
nature of their work and poverty. It was very improbable for anyone born
in this class to advance up the social ladder, or become respected in
the upper classes.<br />
As the name implies, the <em>working class</em> was the social group
that were occupied with manual labor. Not only men were forced to
physical labor, but also the women and children, most often in places
like factories or halls, with little regard to their hygiene, health, or
general well-being.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The middle class</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the group of people that had a stable financial income and
could afford some of the luxuries available during the Victorian times,
but were not part of the aristrocacy of the higher class. Many of the
members of this class were hard workers, usually dealing with the more
intellectual side of work, such as accounting, law, commerce or, more
rarely, even by writing.<br />
It was, at times, possible for people of the working class to work their
way up into the middle class. One such example is the infamous Victorian
writer, Charles Dickens, who spent most of his childhood working at a
factory, but managed to gain a considerable fortune in his adult years
working as a writer and journalist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The upper class</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the members of the upper class were born as such due to
family connections or bloodline from a royal family. These people held
the highest social status in England, and were usually the wealthiest,
owning a lot of land or businesses. They were also the people to hold
the highest political power of the time and, as such, the lower classes
would very rarely get in contact with any of their members.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="victorian-literature">Victorian Literature</h2>
<p>Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in, most of
Victorian literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour,
and witful stories. These comical works served as a way for the writers
to express their distaste with the way that British society had evolved,
while also being of great value to the common reader, who began to felt
noticed and appreciated, and could relate to the stories and challenges
faced by many of the characters found in such tales. The most popular of
these works are, by far, Charles Dickens’ semi- autobiographical novels.

<p>Charles Dickens (1812 – 1870) was an English novelist, journalist,
and social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical
novels, commonly refered to as <em>“social novels”</em>, due to the
social themes that are scattered throughout his work. Dickens’ literary
output greatly influenced many other English authors and is still
enjoyed by critics and readers well into our current era, with novels
like <em>A Christmas Carol</em> enjoying modern adaptations into film,
musicals, and children’s cartoons.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was born into a poor family but enjoyed relatively
decent living conditions during the first years of his life. However,
things took a turn for the worse after he turned 12 years old, when his
father was arrested and sent to prison, due to not being able to pay his
taxes on time. For young Dickens, this meant having to quit school and
start doing manual labor in order to sustain his poor family. Thus,
young Dickens had to work in a very poor factory with severely
unsanitary working conditions. Lamentably so, child labor was very
common during the Victorian Age, and consequently, during Dickens’ time.
His childhood experiences served as the base for his writings, having
greatly impacted his way of thinking and ethics.</p>
<p>Dickens began his writing career while he was still a teenager, and
gradually started going up the social ladder from his modest income. His
writing was an almost instant hit in England, largely due to the
auto-biographical elements that captivated readers, and the ethical
themes tackled in his stories. His novels are commonly referred to as
<em>social novels</em>, and indeed the social inequality and ethical
problems of Victorian England shown in Dickens’ novels were highly
influential during his time, since most of his readers could relate to
the suffering and injustice faced by his characters. Two of his most
popular novels, <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>David
Copperfield</em> were directly inspired by his childhood.</p>
<p>One of Charles Dickens’ novels that best encompasses his writing
style is the aforementioned <em>David Copperfied</em>. The novel is a
bildungsroman (a coming of age story), closely following the life of the
eponymous character, David Copperfield, from his early childhood well
into his maturity. This is, perhaps, the novel where the
autobiographical elements of Dicken’s writing can be seen the most.
Starting with the main character’s name, which matches the author’s own
initials (D.C. and C.D.), to his calm demeanor and personality, and his
path to becomming a successful writer. In fact, Dickens affirms in his
own words that this novel had a very special place in his heart,
declaring:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“Of all my books, I like this the
best.”</em></div>
<p>Charles Dickens’ contributions to English literature greatly
influenced the rising popularity of the novel as a literary form that
can be enjoyed by the masses. His social and ethical themes also paved
the way to shaping the opinions and ideas of many of his readers,
greatly contributing to raising awareness among people of the higher
classes regarding the greatly disturbing living conditions of those of
the lower class.</p>
<h1 id="the-victorian-novel-and-novelists">The Victorian Novel and
Novelists</h1>
<h2 id="w.-m.-thackeray">W. M. Thackeray</h2>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 – 1863) was an English novelist and
illustrator most appreciated for his satirical works. He was born in
Calcutta<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in Brittish India, and moved to
England after his father’s death in 1815. His background having been
born into one of the territories under colonial rule of England has
greatly influenced his work, as can be seen in his novel <em>Vanity
Fair</em>, a satire novel criticizing 19th century British society.</p>
<p>Thackeray first started writing while working for a few newspapers,
and later chose to write books as his primary source of income,
publishing under a number of pseudonyms. His first novels were satires
and parodies, but his first successful and most popular work was
<em>Vanity Fair</em>, published in monthly parts from 1847 to 1848,
under his real name. The choice to publish in a serial format was likely
inspired by Charles Dickens’ success in using this method of publishing.
Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em> was, by far, his most successful work,
with critics placing him second only to Charles Dickens during his
lifetime.</p>
<p><em>Vanity Fair</em> is a satirical novel largely mocking of English
society during Victorian times. The work stands out because of its
satirisation of 19th century British societal norms, as can be noticed
from its two subtitles, first published with the subtitle <em>“Pen and
Pencil Sketches of English Society”</em>, then republished as a single
volume with the subtitle <em>“A novel without a hero”</em>, hinting at
its sarcastic nature. The novel is written like a puppet play and is one
of the first examples of an <em>unreliable</em> narrator in English
literature.</p>
<h2 id="the-brontë-sisters">The Brontë Sisters</h2>
<p>The Brontë Sisters were, as the name implies, a group of sisters from
the Brontë family, all of whom were novelists and poets. The sisters –
Charlotte, Emily, and Anne – all had published their works under male
pseudonyms taken from their initials in order to avoid scrutiny from
readers and critics: <strong>Currer Bell</strong>, <strong>Ellis
Bell</strong>, and <strong>Acton Bell</strong>.</p>
<p>Two novels written by the sisters are most widely acclaimed by
critics for thier literary value, namely <em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte
Brontë, and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> by Emily Brontë.</p>
<h3 id="emily-brontë">Emily Brontë</h3>
<p>Emily Brontë (1818 – 1848) was the fifth of the six Brontë siblings,
of whom only four survived into adulthood. Her only novel, <em>Wuthering
Heights</em>, published in 1847, under the pen name <strong>Ellis
Bell</strong> is commonly considered one of the greatest novels written
in English.</p>
<h3 id="charlotte-brontë">Charlotte Brontë</h3>
<p>Charlotte Brontë (1816 – 1855) was the elder sister of the Emily and
Anne. Her most known work is the novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, published in
the year 1848 under her pseudonym <strong>Currer Bell</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="george-eliot">George Eliot</h2>
<p>George Eliot (1819 – 1880), under her real name, Marry Ann Evans, was
an English novelist, journalist, and poet. She has written seven novels
in total, the most popular of which are <em>Adam Bede</em> (1859),
<em>Middlemarch</em> (1871), and <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> (1860).
George Eliot’s works popularised the use of literary realism across a
diverse number of authors, including her contemporaries.</p>
<h3 id="middlemarch">Middlemarch</h3>
<p><em>Middlemarch</em> is George Eliot’s most popular novel. The novel
was serialised in eight volumes from 1871 to 1872, and was published
with the subtitle <em>“A Study of Provincial Life”</em></p>
<h3 id="adam-bede">Adam Bede</h3>
<h3 id="literary-realism">Literary realism</h3>
<h2 id="thomas-hardy">Thomas Hardy</h2>
<p>Thomas Hardy (1840 – 1928) was an English novelist and poet, best
known for his famous social novel, <em>Tess of d’Urbervilles</em>,
largely disputed at the time of its publishing due to the way in which
it depicted the crude hardships faced by women during Victorian times.
His novels fit into two main themes: Realism and Romanticism.</p>
<p>Hardy’s works have been profoundly influenced by the contrast between
his own chilhood living in a quiet rural village in Higher Bockhampton,
and the busy life of London, where he worked from 1862 as a draftsman,
designing and restoring churches.</p>
<p>Despite being generally regarded as a novelist by most critics, Hardy
considered himself fundamentally a poet. His first novel, <em>The Poor
Man and the Lady</em> was ill received and rejected by all the
publishers he contacted, leading to it never being published. The
manuscript was destroyed by Hardy in his later years and no copies of it
exist.</p>
