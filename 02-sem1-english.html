<h1 id="the-victorian-age">The Victorian Age</h1>
<p>The Victorian Age is one of the most intriguing periods of English
history, being in itself a period of contradictions, moral uncertainty,
and prejudice. Its name comes from the reign of Queen Victoria (1819 –
1901), whose reign of 63 years and 216 days defined the Victorian era as
a whole, outlasting that of any of her predecessors.</p>
<p>The Victorian era also marks the beginning of industrialization, the
rising interest in scientific experiments and discoveries, and a
widening horizon due to the expansion of the British Empire (notably,
Queen Victoria was the first empress of India). These changes and
discoveries, in turn, drastically transformed the lives of English
people, common folk and nobility alike.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-ethos-and-society">Victorian Ethos and Society</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Victorian era is, perhaps, best described by
its contradictions, the stark contrast between what was considered
socially adequate and proper, and what many people faced and saw.</p>
<h2 id="victorian-literature">Victorian Literature</h2>
<p>Though it may seem like a grim period for anyone to live in,
Victorian Literature is remarkably abundant in works of satire, humour,
and witfulness. These comical works served as a way for the writers to
express their distaste with the way that British society had evolved,
while also being of great value to the common reader, who began to felt
noticed and appreciated, and could relate to the stories and challenges
faced by many of the characters found in such tales. The most popular of
these works are, by far, Charles Dickens’ semi- autobiographical novels.
(see chapter <a href="#charles%20dickens">Charles Dickens</a>).</p>

<h1 id="charles-dickens">Charles Dickens</h1>
<p>Charles Dickens (1812 – 1870) was an English novelist and journalist,
and social critic. He is most well-known for his semi-autobiographical
novels, commonly refered to as <em>“social novels”</em>, due to the
social themes that are scattered throughout his work. Dickens’ literary
output greatly influenced many other English authors and is still
enjoyed by critics and readers well into our current era, with novels
like <em>A Christmas Carol</em> enjoying modern adaptations into film,
musicals, and children’s cartoons.</p>
